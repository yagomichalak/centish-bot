Let’s talk about the **Centish** language, this language first started as a joke in another Discord server, and its name is inspired in <@692499703908139135>, a fabulous Italian girl who I (<@647452832852869120>) had the biggest pleasure to meet, and then, after a while, I asked her whether she wanted to make the language with me for real, and she accepted it right away, on August the 18th.

Regarding the etymology of words created in the **Centish** language, it is mostly based a bit on romance languages and we add an extra touch of imagination to make it more unique. This language was first intended to not be grammatically difficult, so all verbs are conjugated exactly the same for all subjects, changing just a tiny bit in other tenses, which are easily done by attaching their respective suffixes to the verb’s present tense form. 

Although it was intended to be romance based, with a few features of Germanic languages, if you hear the language being spoken you will notice straight away that it doesn’t sound Romanic at all. It sounds more like a Slavic or an Eastern European language, and it may be due to the fact that it relies a lot on the ecclesiastical pronunciation, also with minor changes for the sake of us wanting it.

Hopefully, as the time goes by, this language will develop itself enough to the point that it becomes a full functional language, so people can actually talk about things in a vast range of subjects, without lacking any major meaning, detail, aspect or important feature of the commonly known well-developed languages that there are out there.
