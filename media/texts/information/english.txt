Welcome to the **Centish Club** server, which is a server dedicated to developing, maintaining, improving and learning the **Centish** constructed language.

In this server you will get updates on the language development on a daily basis, and you will also be able to discuss with people about the language, give us suggestions, ideas, opinions and feedback.

We have a nice and chill environment for everybody, of which you can make part by partaking in casual or in-depth discussions about anything. We also have our own custom **bot** for the server that gives us some extra and interesting functionalities that you might want to take a look at.
